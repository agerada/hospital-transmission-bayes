  abstract = {Background. Control of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is an increasingly difficult problem for health care institutions. There are commonly recommended strategies to combat CDI transmission, such as oral vancomycin for CDI treatment, increased hand hygiene with soap and water for health care workers, daily environmental disinfection of infected patient rooms, and contact isolation of diseased patients. However, the efficacy of these strategies, particularly for endemic CDI, has not been well studied. The objective of this research is to develop a valid, agent-based simulation model (ABM) to study C. difficile transmission and control in a midsized hospital. Methods. We develop an ABM of a midsized hospital with agents such as patients, health care workers, and visitors. We model the natural progression of CDI in a patient using a Markov chain and the transmission of CDI through agent and environmental interactions. We derive input parameters from aggregate patient data from the 2007–2010 Wisconsin Hospital Association and published medical literature. We define a calibration process, which we use to estimate transition probabilities of the Markov model by comparing simulation results to benchmark values found in published literature. Results. In a comparison of CDI control strategies implemented individually, routine bleach disinfection of CDI-positive patient rooms provides the largest reduction in nosocomial asymptomatic colonization (21.8\%) and nosocomial CDIs (42.8\%). Additionally, vancomycin treatment provides the largest reduction in relapse CDIs (41.9\%), CDI-related mortalities (68.5\%), and total patient length of stay (21.6\%). Conclusion. We develop a generalized ABM for CDI control that can be customized and further expanded to specific institutions and/or scenarios. Additionally, we estimate transition probabilities for a Markov model of natural CDI progression in a patient through calibration.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY                            Clostridium difficile               is the main causative agent of antibiotic-associated and health care-associated infective diarrhea. Recently, there has been growing interest in alternative sources of               C. difficile               other than patients with               Clostridium difficile               infection (CDI) and the hospital environment. Notably, the role of               C. difficile               -colonized patients as a possible source of transmission has received attention. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of               C. difficile               colonization. Findings from gut microbiota studies yield more insights into determinants that are important for acquiring or resisting colonization and progression to CDI. In discussions on the prevalence of               C. difficile               colonization among populations and its associated risk factors, colonized patients at hospital admission merit more attention, as findings from the literature have pointed to their role in both health care-associated transmission of               C. difficile               and a higher risk of progression to CDI once admitted.               C. difficile               colonization among patients at admission may have clinical implications, although further research is needed to identify if interventions are beneficial for preventing transmission or overcoming progression to CDI.},

Methods                                We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to acute care hospitals between April 2011 and March 2012 in Ontario, Canada. Hospital prevention practices were determined by survey of infection control programmes; responses were linked to patient-level risk factors and                 C. difficile                 outcomes in Ontario administrative databases. Multivariable generalised estimating equation (GEE) regression models were used to assess the impact of selected understudied hospital prevention processes on the patient-level risk of                 C. difficile                 infection, accounting for patient risk factors, baseline                 C. difficile                 rates and structural hospital characteristics.

Implementation of the selected                 C. difficile                 prevention practices was variable across the 159 hospitals with isolation of all patients at onset of diarrhoea reported by 43 (27\%), auditing of antibiotic stewardship compliance by 26 (16\%), auditing of cleaning practices by 115 (72\%), on-site diagnostic testing by 74 (47\%), vancomycin as first-line treatment by 24 (15\%) and reporting rates to senior leadership by 52 (33\%). None of these processes were associated with a significantly reduced risk of                 C. difficile                 after adjustment for baseline                 C. difficile                 rates, structural hospital characteristics and patient-level factors.

Using an agent-based model (ABM), we simulated the transmission of VRE within and between 3 care units according to different IPC measures.                                         Methods:               The ABM was modelled on short-stay medical wards, represented by 2 conventional care units and 1 intensive care unit. The scenarios consisted of the simulation of various compliance rates of caregivers with regard to hand hygiene (HH) in different contexts of IPC measures: (1) standard precautions for all patients, (2) additional contact precautions for VRE-carrier patients, (3) geographical cohorting of carrier patients, and (4) creation of an isolation unit with dedicated staff.                                         Results:               With {$<$}50\% HH compliance, the dissemination of VRE was not adequately controlled. With 80\% compliance for all patients (ie, standard precautions scenario), there were no secondary VRE cases in 50\% of the simulations, which represented the best scenario. A more realistic rate, 60\% HH compliance for all patients, revealed interesting results. Implementing an isolation unit was effective only if the level of HH compliance was low. Patient cohorting was less effective.                                         Conclusions:               The present ABM showed that while contact precautions, geographic cohorting, and an isolation unit may represent good complements to standard precautions, they may theoretically not be necessary if HH is followed at a high level of compliance.},

For this aim, we propose a model to characterize the effect of interventions at single ward level. We adapted the Ross-Macdonald model to describe hospital cross-transmission dynamics of carbapenem resistant               Klebsiella pneumoniae               (CRKP), considering healthcare workers as the vectors transmitting susceptible and resistant pathogens among admitted patients. The model parameters were estimated from a literature review, further adjusted to reproduce observed clinical outcomes, and validated using real life data from a 2-year study in a university hospital. The model has been further explored through extensive sensitivity analysis, in order to assess the relevance of single interventions as well as their synergistic effects. Our model has been shown to be an effective tool to describe and predict the impact of interventions in reducing the prevalence of CRKP colonisation and infection, and can be extended to other specific hospital and pathological scenarios to produce tailored estimates of the most effective strategies.},

  abstract = {The modelling of many real-world problems relies on computationally heavy simulations of randomly interacting individuals or agents. However, the values of the parameters that underlie the interactions between agents are typically poorly known, and hence they need to be inferred from macroscopic observations of the system. Since statistical inference rests on repeated simulations to sample the parameter space, the high computational expense of these simulations can become a stumbling block. In this paper, we compare two ways to mitigate this issue in a Bayesian setting through the use of machine learning methods: One approach is to construct lightweight surrogate models to substitute the simulations used in inference. Alternatively, one might altogether circumvent the need for Bayesian sampling schemes and directly estimate the posterior distribution. We focus on stochastic simulations that track autonomous agents and present two case studies: tumour growths and the spread of infectious diseases. We demonstrate that good accuracy in inference can be achieved with a relatively small number of simulations, making our machine learning approaches orders of magnitude faster than classical simulation-based methods that rely on sampling the parameter space. However, we find that while some methods generally produce more robust results than others, no algorithm offers a one-size-fits-all solution when attempting to infer model parameters from observations. Instead, one must choose the inference technique with the specific real-world application in mind. The stochastic nature of the considered real-world phenomena poses an additional challenge that can become insurmountable for some approaches. Overall, we find machine learning approaches that create direct inference machines to be promising for real-world applications. We present our findings as general guidelines for modelling practitioners.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To quantify the incidence of CDI and its associated hospital length of stay (LOS) in the United States using a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE via Ovid, Cochrane Library Databases via Wiley, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Complete via EBSCO Information Services, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies published in the United States between 2000 and 2019 that evaluated CDI and its associated LOS. STUDY SELECTION Incidence data were collected only from multicenter studies that had at least 5 sites. The LOS studies were included only if they assessed postinfection LOS or used methods accounting for time to infection using a multistate model or compared propensity score–matched patients with CDI with control patients without CDI. Long-term-care facility studies were excluded. Of the 119 full-text articles, 86 studies (72.3\%) met the selection criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent reviewers performed the data abstraction and quality assessment. Incidence data were pooled only when the denominators used the same units (eg, patient-days). These data were pooled by summing the number of hospital-onset CDI incident cases and the denominators across studies. Random-effects models were used to obtain pooled mean differences. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 value. Data analysis was performed in February 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence of CDI and CDI-associated hospital LOS in the United States. RESULTS When the 13 studies that evaluated incidence data in patient-days due to hospital-onset CDI were pooled, the CDI incidence rate was 8.3 cases per 10 000 patient-days. Among propensity score–matched studies (16 of 20 studies), the CDI-associated mean difference in LOS (in days) between patients with and without CDI varied from 3.0 days (95\% CI, 1.44-4.63 days) to 21.6 days (95\% CI, 19.29-23.90 days). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Pooled estimates from currently available literature suggest that CDI is associated with a large burden on the health care system. However, these estimates should be interpreted with caution because higher-quality studies should be completed to guide future evaluations of CDI prevention and treatment interventions.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel stochastic model for the spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in a population, together with an efficient algorithm for fitting such a model to sample data. We introduce an individual-based model for the epidemic, with the state of the model determining which individuals are colonised by the bacteria. The transmission rate of the epidemic takes into account both individuals’ locations, individuals’ covariates, seasonality, and environmental effects. The state of our model is only partially observed, with data consisting of test results from individuals from a sample of households. Fitting our model to data is challenging due to the large state space of our model. We develop an efficient SMC2 algorithm to estimate parameters and compare models for the transmission rate. We implement this algorithm in a computationally efficient manner by using the scale invariance properties of the underlying epidemic model. Our motivating application focuses on the dynamics of community-acquired extended-spectrum betalactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, using data collected as part of the Drivers of Resistance in Uganda and Malawi project. We infer the parameters of the model and learn key epidemic quantities such as the effective reproduction number, spatial distribution of prevalence, household cluster dynamics, and seasonality.},

Due to increasing capacities of computing resources it was possible to improve the level of detail and structural realism of next‐generation models in recent years. However, this is at the expense of increased model complexity, which requires more efficient tools for model exploration, analysis and documentation that enable reproducibility, repeatability and parallelization. NetLogo is a widely used environment for agent‐based model development, but it does not provide sufficient built‐in tools for extensive model exploration, such as sensitivity analyses. One tool for controlling NetLogo externally is the                     r                     ‐package RN                     et                     L                     ogo                     . However, this package is not suited for efficient, reproducible research as it has stability and resource allocation issues, is not straightforward to be setup and used on high performance computing clusters and does not provide utilities, such as storing and exchanging metadata, in an easy way.                                                                                             We present the                     r                     ‐package                     nlrx                     , which overcomes stability and resource allocation issues by running NetLogo simulations via dynamically created XML experiment files. Class objects make setting up experiments more convenient and helper functions provide many parameter exploration approaches, such as Latin Hypercube designs, Sobol sensitivity analyses or optimization approaches. Output is automatically collected in user‐friendly formats and can be post‐processed with provided utility functions.                     nlrx                     enables reproducibility by storing all relevant information and simulation output of experiments in one                     r                     object which can conveniently be archived and shared.                                                                                             We provide a detailed description of the                     nlrx                     package functions and the overall workflow.

  abstract = {Background: In October 2004, our Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) rate increased (relative risk, 3.51; 95\% confidence interval: 2.96-4.16) from a baseline rate of 1.35 per 1000 patient-days. We describe the outbreak, the relationship between antibiotic use and CDI, and the effect of enhanced infection control measures (EICM) on CDI. Methods: Rates were calculated as positive C difficile toxin A or B tests among patients with nosocomial diarrhea per 1000 patientdays (duplicates removed). Antibiotic use was calculated as defined daily dose per 1000 patient-days. EICM consisted of (1) placing patients with diarrhea into empiric Contact Precautions, (2) cleaning with a bleach product in areas with CDI patients, and (3) requiring soap and water hand hygiene when caring for CDI patients. CDI rates were analyzed by x2 for trend. Time series methodology was used to examine the association between CDI and antibiotic use. Results: During the outbreak (October 2004-May 2005), we observed 144 excess cases of CDI. The CDI rate decreased after EICM were implemented (P , .0001) and has been maintained for 36 months beyond the outbreak. Multivariate analysis revealed positive associations between CDI rates and cefazolin use (P 5 .008) and levofloxacin/gatifloxacin use (P 5 .015). Conclusion: Despite an association between some antibiotic use and CDI rates, we achieved sustained control of an outbreak using EICM without formulary changes or new antibiotic control policies. This suggests that patient-to-patient spread may be a more important cause of increased CDI rates.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To update the evidence for associations between antibiotic classes and hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile infection (HA-CDI). Methods: Electronic databases of journal articles, scholarly theses and conference proceedings using subject headings and keywords related to CDI and antibiotic exposure were searched. Observational epidemiological studies measuring associations between antibiotic classes and HA-CDI were eligible for inclusion. Pooled ORs and 95\% CIs were calculated using a random effects model. Study factors identified a priori were examined as sources of heterogeneity. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results: Of 569 citations identified, 13 case–control and 1 cohort study (15 938 patients) were included. The strongest associations were found for third-generation cephalosporins (OR¼ 3.20, 95\% CI ¼ 1.80– 5.71; n¼ 6 studies; I2 ¼ 79.2\%), clindamycin (2.86, 2.04 –4.02; n ¼ 6; I2 ¼ 28.5\%), second-generation cephalosporins (2.23, 1.47 –3.37; n ¼ 6; I2 ¼ 48.4\%), fourth-generation cephalosporins (2.14, 1.30–3.52; n ¼ 2; I2 ¼ 0.0\%), carbapenems (1.84, 1.26–2.68; n ¼6; I2 ¼ 0.0\%), trimethoprim/sulphonamides (1.78, 1.04 –3.05; n ¼ 5; I2 ¼ 70\%), fluoroquinolones (1.66, 1.17 –2.35; n ¼ 10; I2 ¼ 64\%) and penicillin combinations (1.45, 1.05–2.02; n ¼ 6; I2 ¼ 54\%). The study population and the timing of measurement of antibiotic exposure were the most common sources of heterogeneity. Study quality scored high for seven studies, moderate for six studies and low for one study. Conclusions: The risk of HA-CDI remains greatest for cephalosporins and clindamycin, and their importance as inciting agents should not be minimized. The importance of fluoroquinolones should not be overemphasized, particularly if fluoroquinolone-resistant epidemic strains of C. difficile are absent.},

  abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) constitutes a class of computational methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. ABC methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection. ABC has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology).},
